# As_Calender

# Description
This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 

What was your motivation? I wanted to create code which provides a simple calendar application that allows you to save events for each hour of the day.

Why did you build this project?  I wanted to showcase my jQuery skills

What problem does it solve? 
* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
* Present time blocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
* Color-code each time block based on past, present, and future when the time block is viewed.
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a time block
* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that time block.
* Persist events between refreshes of a page
